A simple game I developed for my studies at university using python and pygame. Have fun!

You are a future husband, who has wedding cold feet. So try to avoid any collisions with your upcoming wife.
Use arrow keys to move.
In start and endscreen, use escape to leave the game.
In main game window, use escape to return to the start screen.

The highscore is equivalent to the seconds you are in game avoiding any collision. The three highscores are saved in the score.txt inside the score directory.

Thanks to the random module, the wife is moving randomly in speed and direction. So be careful.

I could or should have used inheritance between a mother class and the player and enemy class, but for the sake of this project, as it is a little one, I didn't do so.
Maybe that is something, to implement in the future.

It is a funny little game with some lofi background music.

The comments inside my code are in German. But if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I also used auto py to exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/), to make an executable windows file, which you can download below:
